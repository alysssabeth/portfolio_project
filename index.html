                    <p>
                        Hi there! I'm Alyssa, working on developing my skills to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
                        Looking forward to growing and learning more through Codecademy's detailed 
                        lesson plans and practices. I want to take all that I have learned and apply it to 
                        working for either a start up company or a non-profit to help create their visions and 
                        missions come to life! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why am I taking the leap and learning coding? The challenge that coding has provided has 
                        been the exact thing I have been trying to find to dive into as a career for the last several 
                        years. I am loving every second of it! I have I always been a big picture gal and puzzler, 
                        I love getting to figure out how to piece the code together to develop the bigger picture.
                        Through my learning, I love the fact that this can be a team driven project and/or it can 
                        be working on your own to figure it out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, you will find me hanging out with my husband of 9 years and our two dogs, 
                        Simba and Bruno. I enjoy reading books and putting puzzles together. I love exploring new 
                        places, coffee shops, and trying new restaurants. My husband and I are planning on moving 
                        abroad in the next year to explore a new country (France is the goal) and to see what else is 
                        out there in this big world. My happy place is the ocean and I will be learning to scuba dive 
                        this year. I plan scuba diving any major body of water to explore the great big blue, and hope
                        to be able to see my favorite animal, the Orca, in the wild.
                    </p>

                    Here is my very first web page build. Used basic specs given by Codecademy to create this very basic
                    HTML and CSS web page. It was a challenge for sure in of it self, knowing that this was to get done with
                    the limited knowledge I had. But being the first one I have ever done on my own, it will hold a special
                    place in my heart.

                    This is my second web page. I had learned more HTML and just started to learn CSS. This project specs 
                    were given by Codecademy, it tested me my HTML abilities and  the CSS I had learned to complete this 
                    project. When I had completed it, I was so incredibly proud of myself and had to show everyone I know 
                    what I had accomplished!

                    My third web page created. At this point, I had developed more CSS knowlodge and had tested all my 
                    skills at this point to put this project together. It was the hardest up to this point as I had to 
                    come up with my own theme and really use advanced CSS knowledge to get this one done. My excitment 
                    at the completion of this web page was through the roof and again had to show it off to my people!
